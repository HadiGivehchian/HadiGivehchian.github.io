I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at UC San Diego advised by [Dinesh Bharadia](https://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fweb.eng.ucsd.edu%2F~dineshb%2F&sa=D) and [Aaron Schulman](https://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcseweb.ucsd.edu%2F~schulman%2F&sa=D). I am a part of [Sysnet](https://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sysnet.ucsd.edu%2Fsysnet%2F&sa=D), [CNS](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fcns.ucsd.edu&sa=D) and [WCSNG](https://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwcsng.ucsd.edu%2Findex.html&sa=D) research groups. My research involves developing machine learning and signal processsing algorithms to solve different problems in wireless sensing and security. My research is supported by IARPA and Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship.

Before joining UCSD, I got my B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering (Communication Systems) from Sharif University of Technology, under the supervision of [Mohammad-Ali Maddah-Ali](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CFIJZwoAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Babak Khalaj](https://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fsharif.edu%2F~khalaj%2F&sa=D). We worked on probabilistic modeling and designing efficient memory sharing algorithms for Big Data processing systems using information theoretic approaches.
